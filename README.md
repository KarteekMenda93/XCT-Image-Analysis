# XCT-Image-Analysis

XCT (X-ray computed tomography) image analysis refers to the process of analyzing and interpreting images generated through XCT scanning. XCT scanning is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of an object. These images can provide valuable information about the internal structure, composition, and properties of the scanned object.
